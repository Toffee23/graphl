THE UTILS FOLDER IS THE BASE OF THE MVC ARCHITECTURE

The sample folder is just a base for the MVC arch.

There's a controller and a corresponding view file

The controller is where all the functions and logic is handled

The view is basically where the UI lives

There can also be a widget/component file, this file
is for components that are specific to a screen/feature

Now, once a component/widget is going to be shared by more than one feature, it moves to the shared folder
